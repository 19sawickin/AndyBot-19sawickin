DESIGN CHOICES:
Nesting is when you use a method as one of the arguments while calling another method.
For example, in the solve() method of MazeSolver, the method getHint() was passed into
the method solveRoadBlock() as an argument. The method getHint() generates a random integer,
so nesting it in solveRoadBlock passed a random integer into the solveRoadBlock() method
and assigned it to "x" which was used in further calculations.
